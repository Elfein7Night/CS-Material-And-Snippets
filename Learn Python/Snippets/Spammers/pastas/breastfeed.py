    my 3 month old niece while my brother got his hair cut. So there I am, sitting in the waiting area of a

    looking at him as he was sitting there with his phone and waited, but was too scared to say anything to him. 
    Pretty soon my niece started crying, and I’m trying to quiet her down because I didn’t want her to bother him, 
    but she wouldn’t stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and 
    asked what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So  """ + name + """ put down his 
    phone, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of the barbershop. 
    Chill guy, really nice about it."""
